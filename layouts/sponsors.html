        Swapnil Bhartiya founded Muktware in 2010 to cover Linux and Open Source. He had been covering Linux & Open Source since 2005 and himself
        became a Linux user when a Windows virus wiped 2GB of his images (2GB was a lot back in 2005). He became a staunch supporter of FLOSS when
        he attented the LinuxAsia event as part of the Linux For You magazine. That's when he decided to devote his writing career to Linux and Free Software.
